    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A samosa or singara is a fried South Asian pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, or meat or fish. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.</p>
    <p>The samosa is made with a maida flour shell stuffed with a mixture of mashed potato, soices and vreen chili. The entire pastry is then deep fried to a golden brown color in oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed ginger</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling. Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.</li>

        <li>Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt. Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time. Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.</li>

        <li>Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.</li>

        <li>Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!</li>
